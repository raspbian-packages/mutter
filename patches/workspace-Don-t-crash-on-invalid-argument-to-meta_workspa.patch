Subject: workspace: Don't crash on invalid argument to meta_workspace_index

This is no longer strictly necessary after #2559 was fixed in 44.beta,
but could add some extra robustness by turning a crash into a somewhat
graceful check failure.

TODO: If the upstream merge request is accepted, we can keep applying
this until we upgrade to a version that includes it; but if the upstream
merge request is rejected, we should drop this.
